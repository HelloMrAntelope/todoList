Demo of Current Application State
This demo showcases the following features of the app:

- Adding Tasks
- Deleting Tasks
- Checking Completed Tasks
- Favoriting Tasks
- Renaming Tasks

Future Plans/Working on:
- Changing the color theme for a more personalized look
- Making it so that when I mark an item as completed, the item goes down to its own completed tasks section.
- Implementing smooth gliding animations for tasks
- Uploading the app to the Google Play Store and potentially the App Store for public release
