Demo of Current Application State
This demo showcases the following features of the app:

- Adding Tasks
- Deleting Tasks
- Checking Completed Tasks
- Favoriting Tasks
- Renaming Tasks

Future Plans/Working on:
- Changing the color theme for a more personalized look
- Making it so that when I mark an item as completed, the item goes down to its own completed tasks section.
- Implementing smooth gliding animations for tasks
- Uploading the app to the Google Play Store and potentially the App Store for public release

Current Imporovements made and am still working on as of 3/3/2025 3:30PM EST. Will post a video update sooner or later

- [x] Remove Banana Theme because it is overbearing and doesnt look nice especially when favoriting a task. 
- [x] Make it so that the white letters in the light themes get switched to black and vise versa.
  - [ ] Apply this same concept for the text within the Premium page.
- [x] Make app design look nicer.
- [x] Make top header/navigation area change color for the other pages based on chosen theme. -- This task was the most challenging compared to the other listed tasks because the hompage nav bar is custom made.
- [ ] Make dropdown menu dissapear after navigating to a page without having to click the gear icon at the top of the homepage.
- [ ] Make it so that the "X" delete icon looks nicer within the Bold Red theme.
-- Will update soon. Thanks.
